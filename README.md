"Description": This project demonstrates how to use optimization techniques to solve a real-world business problem. Specifically, it focuses on production planning for a factory that makes two products with limited machine time and labor hours. The goal is to figure out the best number of units of each product to make in order to maximize profit without exceeding the available resources. The solution is developed using Python and the PuLP library in a Jupyter notebook. The notebook includes a clear description of the problem, the mathematical model with decision variables, objective function, and constraints, as well as the Python code to solve it. Finally, it explains the results and provides insights on how this solution can support better production planning decisions. This approach can be adapted for other business optimization problems where resources are limited and profits need to be maximized.
